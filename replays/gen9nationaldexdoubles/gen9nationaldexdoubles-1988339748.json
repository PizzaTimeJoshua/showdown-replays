Tuesday|I feel like in some ways intimidate is healthy like in this format, but other it was way to op\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|But it became worse cause one of the best setup mons is

setters\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Double em\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Or go lead with whim\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|As taunt and encore is annoying af\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Unless the TR is farigiraf, then u gotta kill it\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|why doublr in to them tho. also may rate my sand team I it's a little off meta but it's fun, I think you enjoy using it\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|To guarantee a kill\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|tr my bad lmao\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I though you meant terrain\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|For example, cress is decently bulky\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|So I should double it with something like Rilla Wood Hammer and Flutter SBall\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|U got a sand team?\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Show me\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I enjoy some sand, as I used to run that in the kickoff\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Actually, I ran a lot of different teams\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I see Cress is stupidly bulky sure I will share it\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|https:\/\/pokepast.es\/edb8330787312cff\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|it's weird but fun at the same time\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I like using off meta shit so it was a blast\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Why don't u run scale shot on Mega Chomp?\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|So u can outspeed mons and fire off potentially SD and sand boosted EQs\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Or u could run tailwind mon\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|because it needs the bulk this spead live a bizzard from spa advestment for ninetails\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Oh\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I ran rill in stead of a tailwind mon because palfin would solo me\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|my bad no advestment in spa\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|the bulky ones\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|That's mine lmao\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I run max hp\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|To live mega gross BP\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I just tera water or try to get rid of the gross I like playing mind games wth vail so with spa investment it hid hard with blizzard\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I try to not Tera, cause only one Tera in a game\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|And Zygarde like it\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|yeah that shit can bite you in the ass later, I should change my tera to normal, that used to be my standard but I started using fire to stop burns\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I like tera normal for marshadow\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Cause cress can heal the burns\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|true cress is amazing\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|It's just an amazing mon here\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Able to heal any mon and remove status\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|And has support moves like helping hand, ally switch and icy wind\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|And TR\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Cress is just a good mon in every doubles format\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|That's why it was in the CHALK core\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|It can also be offense too tried this shored power set with some sucess but the team got solo by marsh\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Yeah, u gotta Tera Normal to avoid the boost steal\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|And even then, I become weak to cc\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|That why I also suggest Zama for that set\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|To use coaching to power up Stored Power and make it unkillable on both sides with coaching and calm mind\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|All u need left is either to remove darks if u run mono stored power\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I had zygarde be the tera norm to be my main sweeper but with no screens it died to cc, cress was ment to sweep if I saw they were disrepecting it the team was meant boost up and over welm the team, and it was constant than evee boosting\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|then mega lucario would clean up with chein pao\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Oh, u had mega lucario?\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|i think I versued you with it\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I might have, cause I remembered fighting a few mega Luc teams\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|I saw aria play lucario and ready I used that to get 1400s on the first time on ladder on the format\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Oh\n|c|\u2606Pancake Tuesday|bro my spelling it at a all time low sorry I better than this\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|Lmao\n|c|\u2606Old McBruh|I don't mind that
