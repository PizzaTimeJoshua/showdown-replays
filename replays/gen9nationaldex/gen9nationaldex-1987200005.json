awful\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Yea\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|gg\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Do you think stall is unskilled\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I say GG to be polite but that made me hurt physically\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Yes\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I do\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Try to play it and be good at it\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I have\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|It's not hard\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I've never made full stall\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Uh huh\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|But\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|You just press the same buttons every time\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Its a basic concept of this walls that\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|not hard to comprehend from either end of the spectrum\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Stall is very easy to play\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Not necessarily\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|If you mishandle threats you get eaten alivr\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|And when you have 6 of them it's almost impossible to win with an offensive team\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|heatran\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|whatsit\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|hatterene sometimes without clod\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Even now\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|i let you get rocks up\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Bc i didnt lead sableye\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|That's like saying \"It's hard because if you send out Lando against Abomasnow it's a bad time\"\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Yea you control the team you play\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|you can built it to work around certain threats\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I was making fun of your argument\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|if it loses to something, tweak it, but dont expect it to beat it without changing it\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Im talking about generic threats\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Stall is incredibly easy to play as long as you don't do anything stupid\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Heatran is ever present\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Tell mr\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Like letting a volc get to Ultra Instinct without a clod or somethign\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|what advanced plays did you make that made me have to do something difficult\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|nothing, you didnt make any crazy predictions\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Yeah\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Why?\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|you played extremely simply\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Well no duh\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I didn't have any counters\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|which is extremely simple to counter lol\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|What else would i do\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|It's called giving up because you know you don't have any real options\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Well can you really complain about it if its a team issue?\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Your team has an answer to pretty much everything on mine\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Yes\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Thats how i built the team yes\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|to have an answer to everything\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Because this is literally *the* NDOU stall\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|if its typical and predictable like you\u2019re saying, why didnt you build to counter it?\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Because I can't do that without altering the core of the team massively\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Valiant gets psyshock\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Not hard to fit in\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Taunt on lando\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|I've been running the Special set from Smogon\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Etc etc\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Yea psyshock is a special move lol\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Either way\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Val's current set all 4 moves are important\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|I would argue focus blast is replacable\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|You're right that I need to add some psychic coverage, but it's not like I can just take out anything I want\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Not really, since that covers the 2nd stab and also it's probably my most used move in terms of experience with this team so far\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Oh well\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Good luck beating stall next time\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|with maybe a different team even\n|c|\u2606Minimimik|Cya\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Full stall is just a pain in the ass, and I can't really cover all of it so I don't\n|c|\u2606Robonion42|Cya\n|l|\u2606Minimimik\n","uploadtime":1699565978,"views":23,"p1id":"minimimik","p2id":"robonion42","formatid":"gen9nationaldex","rating":1315,"private":0,"password":""}
