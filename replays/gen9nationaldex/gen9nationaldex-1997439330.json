Chef|yet garganacl\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|gets to exist\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|i like using kingambit and wake but those are the only cool new mons\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|when its 100x worse than gliscor\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|i know right\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|garganacl is so anti-fun to encounter\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|its so much worse than gen 7 toxapex\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|idk what they were thinking when they added garg and dondozo]\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i would gladly face 20 gen 7 toxapex than a single garganacl\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|since you could at least have a chance to blow it up\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|garganacl is absurdly tank cant be status\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|and has the best status move in the game\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|they just been thinking \"whats the most unfun, unfair pokemon we can make?\" then adding it to the gamefr\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|while looking like donkey kong stuck between a rock\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|they fact that he looks so stupic is what makes me the most mad\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|half the new designs that arent evolutions of existing pokemon or paradox pokemon\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|absolutely suck ass\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|then they also made gholdingo\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i hate gholdingo too\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|they stopped giving a fuck after gen 7\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|its literally just string cheese on a surf board\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|I will say this\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|tinkaton is one good design though\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|gambit and valiant are they only gen 9 mons i like\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|and kingambit\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|tinkaton is cool\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|to bad hes not good though\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but it copies what made bisharp cool\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|so i cant count it as gen 9 original\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|same as the paradox mons\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|yeah your right\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|roaring moon is cool an all\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|bax isnt even that cool either\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but its just an edited salamence\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|same as iron valiant\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|bax is a homage to godzilla\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but we already had a pokemon that did that\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|tyranitar\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|and they dropped the ball on what mons to give a paradox form\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i do love than donphan got a lot of love\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|who the hell wanted slither wing? why not a paradox gardivor along with galade\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|also paradox tyranitar\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|i def miss spelt both those pokemon lol\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|is ass\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|yet we got a paradox delibird instead\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|tbh delibird deserved the glow up\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|being trash tier for so long\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|if they hire he and game freak studios im making them 1 million dollars in 1 week i swear\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but have you seen some of the fan paradox pokemon?\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|they put game freak to shame\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|future blastoise looking like an actual tank\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|future greninja thats a cyborg assassin\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|yeah there was a paradox mawile that ws insane\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|they even made a past form of the original dragon the fused zekrom and reshiram\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|imagine i paradox necrozma or something cool (unlike deilbird)\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|most the paradox pokemon arent even that cool too\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|i only like flutter mane, moon, wake, tusk and val\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|which is like half of them so i guess i take it back lol\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|you still there??\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|sorry got a call\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but yeah so many cool versions we could have got\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but instead the same pokemon that get gifted a lot\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|at least we didnt get a pikachu or charizard\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|then they had the audacity to make that glorified flash game near 60$ with 2 DLC's\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|ive played the game for a total of 20 minute and game across two game breaking glitches\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|you know\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|if not for the name pokemon\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|this game would be absolutely slaughtered by major fans\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|its literally the sonic 06 of pokemon\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|which is funny\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i thought sonic frontiers was gonna fail miserably and pokemon succeed this last year\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|pokemon is lucky they had so much success back in the day that it cant fail anymore\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|sonic frontiers absolutely dominated\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|while pokemon definitely lost a lot of luster\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|was the game good? i never played it\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|it was\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|the best 3D sonic game in well over a decade and a half\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|I just saw people hating on it before it even came out\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|well\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|sonic had a massive redemption arc\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|people are addicted to hating though\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|the footage ign was showing off was from 2020\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|instead of closer to finished\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|so ign just screwed them for some reason\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|thats funny\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|ign notoriously hates sonic\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|but even they had to backtrack and say they were wrong\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|sonic team even dedicated a whole ost to the fans\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|thanking them for never giving up\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|its even surreal with what sega said recently\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|they wanna challenge mario and surpass him\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|thats hilarious that ign and sonic are beefing\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|just like the old days in the 90's\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|unfortunately i dont think sonic can ever surpass mario now\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|and i dont even like mario\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i dunno man\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|if any platformer icon can do it\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|its sonic\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|yeah sonic is the only one with a chance\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|next to mario hes the second biggest platformer franchise\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|but mario cant fail anymore\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|crash, sly cooper, ratchet and clank cant even come close\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|its too big\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|yeah but its not the surpassing part thats inspiring though\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|nobody talks about those games anymore\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|that sega wants to improve to get to that level\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|sega come back arc is gonna be insane\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|it is and im here for it\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|i hope they take mario down\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|sonic is just that much more likeable for me\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|mario is cool and all sonic just has so much more personality and admiration\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|mario doesnt have a single thing likable about him\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|i mean if we're being honest\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|name one thing he said other than \"letsa goo\"\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|mario is an asshole\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|fuck mario\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|remember when he grinded on luigi's shoe\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|just for doing better than him\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|and they want us to think hes a hero\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|yea hes a murderer honestly\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|so bowser turned all the toads into blocks\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|in the original mario world games\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|mario smashes them all\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|bro murders turtles and does shrooms and im suppose to look up to him\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|bowser is the hero here\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|pause on that but yeah\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|trying to protect his son against a murderous plumber\n|c|\u2606TheIllustriousYUBI|exactly\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|we should finish this battle though\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|xD\n|c|\u2606Fantastic Mr Chef|we been here like an
